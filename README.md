# DSP-Project-2020
Digital Signal Processing Project: Voice Activity Detection 
UCT

This code was used to implement a 4th Year DSP Project completed by Inessa Rajah (RJHINE001) and Mic Rosato (RSTMIC005) on the topic of Voice Activity Detection.  
The project was completed using MATLAB.
The name of each file corresponds to the VAD threshold method implemented in that code.
